Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- You can see deployement by clicking on DEMO above. Open DevTool and resize as you wish.
- Try to avoid fixed widths as much as possible they are unconvenients and time-consuming for responsive coding. 
- Nested containers and flex are powerfull.
- BEM is cool, please enjoy [cheat sheet](#acknowledgements) for naming inspiration in section below.
- It was like tinkering, you know when you start but never when you finish. 
- I played with Github, created another account and did a pull request. I Used rebase, branches. SSH keys to work on same project on two differents machines.
- Next project i'll use styled component.
